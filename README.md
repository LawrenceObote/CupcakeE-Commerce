# Cupcake E-Commerce Site

## Mission Statement 
This app was created to display the cupcake shop's products and their contact information. 
Visitors can visit the site and leave a comment on their experience with the cupcake-shop as
well as get information about upcoming deals and sales. The site has a responsive mobile design 
which allows users to browse on their phone.

## Technologies used in the making of this site.
BootStrap, React, Java, Springboot, JavaScript, PostgreSQL and Hibernate were all used to create this site.
Some of the unsolved problems are the deployement of the site. The crud capabilities that were working
on the local site are not working on the heroku deployed version. The order of the comment section changes when a comment is updated.
A lot of the columns of data share the same id's which can be a bit confusing from a developer point of view.
